# Source Codes Learning

To search and learn the built-in functions in python source codes.

pycharm cannot jump to definition of each function and variables for C/C++ projects, so it needs to uses other tools 
(such as VS, NetBeans IDE).

start from 'PyTypeObject' in  "cpython_3.8.0_alpha_source_codes/Include/cpython/object.h" and bltinmodule.c in 
"cpython_3.8.0_alpha_source_codes/Python/bltinmodule.c"
